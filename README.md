# DuplicateMod

#### _Plugin for [Kanboard](https://github.com/fguillot/kanboard "Kanboard - Kanban Project Management Software")_

Alternative duplication controller. As of the start of this project, the plugin only gets rid of the question, if a task should be duplicated.

Since v1.1 it also has a config setting to set a custom duplication prefix for the duplicated task title (or leave it blank to have none!). Also since this version the plugin can add a week number to the week pattern, yet this needs the [WeekHelper](https://github.com/Tagirijus/WeekHelper) >=v2.7.0 plugin to work.
